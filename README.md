# simple_raytracing
Small-scale raytracing program written in Rust, based on "Raytracing In One Weekend" by Peter Shirley (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
I started this project to get familiar with Rust and apply a few mathematical concepts in the process, which I tend to enjoy.

In the future, I hope to improve the efficiency of the code, provide the user with options in regards to the objects which will be rendered, as well as add new types of objects.
